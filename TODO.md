# MyAgilityQs TODO

## ‚úÖ Recently Completed

- ‚úÖ **Fixed Main Menu height issue** - Reduced container padding (`py="xl"` ‚Üí `py="md"`), stack gaps (`gap="xl"` ‚Üí `gap="md"`), button heights (80px ‚Üí 64px), and logout button margin (`mt="xl"` ‚Üí `mt="md"`) to eliminate mobile browser wiggling
- ‚úÖ **Removed Login Success toast** - Eliminated unnecessary "Welcome! Successfully signed in with Google" notification from OAuth callback
- ‚úÖ **Removed "Refresh Token (Debug)" button** - Cleaned up Profile page by removing debug functionality and related imports
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced PWA installation visibility** - Added service worker registration, created InstallPrompt component, and integrated PWA install options into Main Menu and Profile pages
- ‚úÖ **Updated TODO.md checklists** - Reflected recent progress and completed items
- ‚úÖ **Track Qs Only setting persistence** - Discovered that Google Auth was always resetting trackQsOnly to false; fixed.

## ‚ú® Feature Ideas

- [ ] Photo management: Attach a photo of each dog
- [ ] Data export: CSV export for backup purposes

## üîß Technical Improvements

- [ ] **Sentry.io Error Tracking Integration** (Priority: High)
  - [x] **Client Setup**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
    - [x] Install `@sentry/react` and `@sentry/tracing` packages
    - [x] Initialize Sentry in `client/src/main.tsx` before React app starts
    - [x] Add Sentry environment variables to client build process (`.env` & `.env.example`)
    - [x] Integrate with existing ErrorBoundary component (`components/ErrorBoundary.tsx:28-37`)
    - [x] Add React Router integration for navigation breadcrumbs (`main.tsx:16-19`)
    - [x] Configure performance monitoring for Core Web Vitals (browser tracing + session replay)
    - [x] Add user context (email, userId) for better error tracking (`contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)
    - [ ] Configure source maps upload for production builds
  - [x] **Server Setup**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
    - [x] Install `@sentry/serverless` package for AWS Lambda
    - [x] Initialize Sentry in `server/src/index.ts` Lambda handler (`index.ts:15-19`)
    - [x] Add Sentry environment variables to SAM template (`template.yaml:274-276`)
    - [x] Integrate with existing Middy middleware stack (`index.ts:36`, `sentryContext.ts`)
    - [x] Add custom error contexts (userId, API endpoint, request details) (`utils/sentryHelpers.ts`)
    - [x] Configure Lambda-specific performance monitoring (traces + breadcrumbs)
    - [ ] Set up release tracking for deployments
  - [ ] **Shared Setup**:
    - [ ] Add Sentry types to shared package if needed
    - [ ] Create shared error context utilities
    - [ ] Add Sentry configuration to shared constants
  - [ ] **Environment Configuration**:
    - [ ] Set up separate Sentry projects for dev/prod environments
    - [ ] Configure appropriate error sampling rates
    - [ ] Set up alerts and notifications in Sentry dashboard
    - [ ] Configure team access and permissions
  - [ ] **Integration Points**:
    - [ ] Add Sentry error capturing to TanStack Query error handlers
    - [ ] Integrate with AWS Cognito auth errors
    - [ ] Add custom error tracking for DynamoDB operations
    - [ ] Configure error filtering to reduce noise
  - [ ] **Testing & Deployment**:
    - [ ] Test error reporting in development environment
    - [ ] Verify source maps are working correctly
    - [ ] Test user context and breadcrumbs are captured
    - [ ] Set up CI/CD integration for release tracking
- [ ] Add comprehensive error boundaries
- [ ] Implement offline support with sync
- [ ] Add more comprehensive testing
- [ ] Performance optimization for large datasets
- [ ] Add analytics/metrics tracking
- [x] **PWA Implementation** (Basic functionality completed):
  - [x] Web App Manifest (`client/public/manifest.json`) - app metadata, icons, display mode
  - [x] Service Worker (`client/public/sw.js`) - cache static assets and API responses
  - [x] Installation prompt - detect installability and show custom install button
  - [ ] Offline strategy - cache-first for assets, network-first for API with fallbacks
  - [ ] App shell architecture - cache core UI, lazy load content
  - [ ] Offline run entry - store pending runs locally, sync when connection returns

## üì± UX Enhancements

- [ ] Better mobile navigation patterns
- [ ] Quick entry shortcuts/gestures
- [ ] Bulk operations (edit multiple runs)

## üöÄ Infrastructure

- [ ] Automated backups
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting
- [ ] **Custom Cognito Domain**: Add custom domain to Cognito so "Log in with Google" shows friendly URL instead of ugly Cognito domain
