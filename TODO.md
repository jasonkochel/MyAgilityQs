## üêõ Bugs & Issues

- No known issues at this time

## Next Up

- View Runs: Better filtering on more fields, but it has to stay clean and simple for the basic use case; perhaps a mode to view the data grouped by dog+class+level?

## ‚ú® Feature Ideas

- [ ] Photo management: Attach a photo of each dog
- [ ] Data export: CSV export for backup purposes

## üîß Technical Improvements

- [ ] Add comprehensive error boundaries
- [ ] Implement offline support with sync
- [ ] Add more comprehensive testing
- [ ] Performance optimization for large datasets
- [ ] Add analytics/metrics tracking
- [ ] **PWA Implementation**:
  - [ ] Web App Manifest (`client/public/manifest.json`) - app metadata, icons, display mode
  - [ ] Service Worker (`client/public/sw.js`) - cache static assets and API responses
  - [ ] Installation prompt - detect installability and show custom install button
  - [ ] Offline strategy - cache-first for assets, network-first for API with fallbacks
  - [ ] App shell architecture - cache core UI, lazy load content
  - [ ] Offline run entry - store pending runs locally, sync when connection returns

## üì± UX Enhancements

- [ ] Dark mode support
- [ ] Better mobile navigation patterns
- [ ] Quick entry shortcuts/gestures
- [ ] Bulk operations (edit multiple runs)

## üöÄ Infrastructure

- [ ] Automated backups
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting
- [ ] **Custom Cognito Domain**: Add custom domain to Cognito so "Log in with Google" shows friendly URL instead of ugly Cognito domain
