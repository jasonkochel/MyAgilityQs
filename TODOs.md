## Client

- ✅ "Select Dog" should be two-wide with no text besides the dog's name
- ✅ Some of the class names are too long, so simplified them: "Jumpers with Weaves" -> "Jumpers", "Premier Standard" -> "Premier Std", "Premier Jumpers" -> "Premier JWW"
- ✅ Levels should be highest-to-lowest: Masters, Excellent, Open, Novice
- ✅ "Qualified (Q)" is getting cut off so remove the "(Q)" and remove the emoji
- ✅ "Not Qualified (NQ)" is getting cut off so make it just "NQ" and remove the emoji
- ✅ Placement buttons have too much interior padding so the numbers are cut off on small screens
- ✅ Placement: None should be just "X" so it fits
- ✅ Once the dog and class are selected, we know what level the dog is in for that class, so auto-select it
- ✅ All of the toggle-buttons should be the same color as "dog" -- right now, dog, class, level, and placement (Q and NQ can stay green/red)
